    "Instructions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replace \"yourname\" in the title of this notebook, and \"your name here\" in the markdown above, with your name.\n",
    "2. Create a title for your final project. Preferably, this should indicate what your argument is. Replace \"your title here\" in the markdown above with your title.\n",
    "3. Write your paper, and include everything (your prose in Markdown, your code, and your figures) in this notebook. Don't include the texts you're analyzing. If you generated your corpus programmatically (i.e. using corpus-db.org or some fancy Python), maybe you'll want to include that in the code somewhere here. Your notebook file (`.ipynb`) will be the only thing you turn in.  \n",
    "3. Annotate your code using markdown cells, and/or comment lines (lines beginning with `#`), explaining why you're doing what you're doing. If one of your functions takes certain parameters, for instance, why did you choose those parameters? \n",
    "3. Prune your notebook of unnecessary or redundant code. Run all your code again, to show that it works as-is. Each code cell should have a number in it, and an output, if applicable. \n",
    "4. Proofread well! If English is not your first language, you might consider making an appointment with [the Writing Center](https://slc.berkeley.edu/appointment-service) to get help polishing the language of your paper. At minimum, you'll want to use a spell checker and maybe even an automatic grammar-checking service like [Grammerly](https://www.grammarly.com/). (Of course, you now have the tools to analyze your own writing, if you want. You can get your markdown text into Python by adapting the word count function below, and use it to analyze your most frequent n-grams!) You might also consider organizing a mutual editing session with classmates.\n",
    "4. Ensure that you have no more than three plots (figures). One figure with several subplots is OK, and counts as one figure.\n",
    "4. If you quote from or reference literary works, or works of criticirm, provide in-text parenthetical citations. Then create a bibliographic entry for each work you cite, and include them at the end. Unless your discipline requires a different format, use [MLA Style](https://style.mla.org/) as the format for your bibliography, and title it \"works cited.\" \n",
    "4. Replace the value of the `filename` variable in the wordcount cell below to the name your file. (E.g., `Jonathan-Final.ipynb`.) Then run the wordcount cell. Ensure that your paper is between 1000 and 2000 words, so it doesn't give you any errors or warnings.  \n",
    "5. Optionally, and for a 5% bonus, add your notebook to the `/Projects` directory of the course repository, and submit it as a pull request. Your project will then become public. \n",
    "6. Email me your `.ipynb` file: jonathan.reeve@columbia.edu. Please email me only your `.ipynb` file, alone and uncompressed. Please don't respond to an existing email, but create a new email, with the subject: `Yourname: Final Project`, replacing `yourname` with your name. Do this regardless of whether you also submit a pull request. \n",
    "7. Celebrate! You've finished your final project, and gloriously completed _Introduction to Computational Literary Analysis_!"
