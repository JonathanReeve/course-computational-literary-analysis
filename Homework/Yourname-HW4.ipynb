    " - **MacOS**: open the Terminal app. (Hint: you can open Spotlight, the magnifying glass icon in the upper right, and type \"terminal\")\n",

You'll generally only see `$`, and you're already running as a regular user, so all you'll need to do is to type in the command that follows the `$`, i.e. not including the `$`. So if the command is shown in the SpaCy docs as `$ conda install -c conda-forge spacy`, open a terminal and type `conda install -c conda-forge spacy`, exactly as written. \n",

    "When following the SpaCy instructions, you'll want to choose `conda` as your package manager (because you've installed Anaconda), and 'python3' as your Python version, since we're using Python 3 in this course. Don't select `virtualenv` unless you really know what you're doing. \n",
